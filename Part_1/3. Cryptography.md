### Question 1 (3 marks)

> Explain 3 differences of Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption (hint: keys construct, length limit, efficiency, encryption strength)

Answer in the block below:

```
Three differences between symmetric and asymmetric encryption:

(i) Keys
In symmetric key encryption, the same key used to encrypt the data is used to decrypt the data. 
In asymmetric key encryption, one key is used to only encrypt the data (the public key) and another key is used to decrypt (the private key).
Public Key can lock the vault, however, not unlock it. Only the Private key can unlock the vault. 

(ii) Efficiency and encryption strength: 
Symmetric encryption is revered for speed and efficiency encrypting large amounts of data, while asymmetric encryption is more secure for transmitting data over insecure channels

(iii) Length limit: 
Symmetric encryption is known for shorter keys (usually 128 or 256 bits) than Asymmetric encryption (sometimes 2048 bits or longer). 
New, asymmetric keys (circa 128 bits) are claiming to be faster (40%) than symmetric encryption. For example, “Curve25519,” is an asymmetrical key solution based on Elliptic Curve cryptography (ECC) OpenPGP keys.

### Question 2 (1 mark)

> Can a Hash digest be reversed? Yes or No

Answer in the block below:

```
It appears once a hash is complete it cannot be reversed. Another perspective with regards to the hash .digest() suggesting with Python the .digest() method returns the actual digest the hash is designed to produce.
It is a separate method because the hashing API is designed to accept data in multiple pieces:
hash = hashlib.sha1()
for chunk in large_amount_of_data:
    hash.update(chunk)
final_digest = hash.digest()

You can generate a hash file from data, a photo, folder, document, or art. And you’ll always get the same hash, if it hasn’t changed. For example, The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) offers “Proof as a Service,” providing certificates with hash files to end users to validate authenticity.

Hashing works in one direction only, you can't turn a hash back into its original data..  
If you need to go in two directions, try encrypting, rather than hashing.

### Question 3 (1 mark)

> Which factors can determine the input size limit of an Asymmetric Encryption operation? Name a few (2-3)

Answer in the block below:

```
The maximum input size limit of an asymmetric encryption operation is determined by several factors, including the length of the key used in the encryption, the algorithm used can affect the maximum input size, the padding scheme can add additional data to the input, reducing the amount of data which can be in encrypted.

```

### Question 4 (2 marks)

> Describe the process of digital signing on large data set (larger than a single digital signature process can do)

Answer in the block below:

```
To sign a large dataset, with Python “OpenSSL library”, the process requires splitting the data into smaller parts, “Chunking.” The function reads the files in chunks, signing each separately to verify data integrity and authenticity. It then combines the signatures for the fulsome data file, creating a digital signature for the whole lot which is captured in a separate file.sig extension.
