## Part 1.2. Git & software development (6 marks)

### Question 1 (2 marks)

> In your own understanding, compare and contrast Unit Testing, Integration Testing, End-to-end Testing

Answer in the block below:

```
Unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing are all different types of software testing that serve different purposes at different stages.

Unit Testing
Allows you to run unit tests, debug, and resolve issues locally, on one chunk of code at a time.
For example, AWS re/start students use Visual Studio with Python's built-in unittest module to make sure their homework code is functioning correctly.

Integration testing
Focuses on testing how different units or components of a tech work together, dependencies are important, for example, verifying service/API interactions in a local environment.
For example, AWS re/Start students use Python frameworks like pytest to write and run integration tests for their code .

End-to-End Testing
Requires a holistic lens to test user inputs and steps for digital solutions, from start to finish. This may require planning, timing, clients, third-party vendors, and systems specialists to write test cases and get sign off that the digital solution works as expected in a real-world scenarios.
For example, AWS re/Start students may learn to use frameworks such as Selenium and Behave to write and run end-to-end tests for Python code.

### Question 2 (3 marks)

> What is the purpose of source control tools such as Git/Subversion/Mercury? How would you use such tools for a large development project consisting of multiple people?

Answer in the block below:

```
Source control tools are used by communities to progress, plan, code, build, test, release, deploy, operate, and monitor.
AWS re/Start students may use source control tools such as Git, Subversion, or Mercury, to run their own projects and/or contribute to employer’s, client’s or online communities.

Some source control tools benefits appear to be (i) version control (ii) helping communities keep track of code changes (iii) collaboration on code (iv) knowledge economy and transfer (v) branching/innovation (vi) controlled release and versioning.

For example, when a client deploys cloud/on-premise software with bugs in it to their client’s production environment. Or, delivery teams stop mid- implementation to wait for a bug fix or stable software version (implementation costs) (licencing costs) (time costs).

Developers could use Tags to identify/compare (i) code (ii) release notes, across multiple versions and unique client cloud environments.

Source control tools sound like an opportunity to streamline development, manage online community contributions, assist with designing, testing, fixing, monitoring, and understanding related instances or downstream impacts.

It appears DevOps and SaaS companies are leveraging versioning, reporting, tagging, metadata, and controlled change, for large development projects consisting of multiple people.

### Question 3 (1 mark)

> What is a Git Tag? And why what can you do to streamline software releases?

Answer in the block below:

```
Git Tag is used to bookmark a specific point of time in the project.
For example, annotated tags have a checksum and store metadata such as name, email, date.

Annotated Tags (git tag -a v2.tagname -m "tag comment") require a comment, like git commit.
Lightweight Tags ($ git tag v2.tagname -lw) don’t store metadata/require a comment, but they do checksum a pointer to the code.

Tags appear to facilitate, for example, streamlined review, identification, and reporting.

Tags appear to be useful when sections of code across more than one release need testing /a bug fix.
